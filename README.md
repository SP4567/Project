![Loan Approval Prediction](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png?text=Loan+Approval+Prediction+System)

## Overview

The **Loan Approval Prediction System** leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of loan approvals based on applicant data. This project aims to streamline the loan application process and assist financial institutions in making informed decisions.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to assess loan applications.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for inputting applicant data.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides insights into the factors influencing loan approvals.
- **Video Demonstration**: Includes a video walkthrough of the application.
